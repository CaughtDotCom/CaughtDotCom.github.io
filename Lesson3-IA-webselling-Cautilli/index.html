     <p>This collection is <em>extremely</em> special to me, it includes jerseys from different eras and each hold real significance to me.
        <br> I hope to one day be able to afford these jerseys again.
        <br>  Basketball jersey collecting is a real passion of mine. I feel it can act as an archive of past players and uniforms as well as encapsualting a certain time period.
